# Quantsplainer
###### The purpose of READMEQuant.md file is to provide context beneath the all code.

At my old quantitative investment firm, every financial data-item you could reasonably want would be sitting neatly for you in a SQL table. 
In a few joins, you usually had what you wanted.

Fast forward to now: I got nothin. I can't even start thinking about projects until I have basic, foundational data. For example:
1. a "universe" of names, with a history. 
   - Stated broadly, universes tell us what stocks existed when and in what market category. If you were building a stock-selection model for small-cap companies, you'd want a dated history of small-cap names to compare to one another (i.e. N observations at different times, t).
   - The Russell 3000 (all-cap), R1000 (large cap), MSCI EAFE (international), and many other broad market indices, can provide good starting points for a universe.
2. a benchmark
3. Stock-Level Exposures to Industries
4. Stock-Level Exposures to Styles
5. Understand Market movements
